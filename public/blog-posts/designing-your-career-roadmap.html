  Careers rarely follow a straight line, but that doesn't mean you should drift. A simple 3-year roadmap helps you decide what to learn, which projects to chase, and what to politely ignore.

  <h2>1. Start with an Honest Audit of Where You Are</h2>
  <div class="space-y-4">
    <p>Before you plan the next three years, write down where you actually are—skills, projects, energy levels, and constraints.</p>
    <p>List the kind of work that gives you energy, the work that drains you, and the kind of problems you want to be trusted with.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>2. Define One Direction, Not a Perfect Destination</h2>
  <div class="space-y-4">
    <p>Instead of picking a single dream role, define a direction: for example, 'product roles close to engineering' or 'data-heavy roles that own outcomes'.</p>
    <p>This gives you room to adjust while still knowing what to say no to.</p>

  <h2>3. Break 3 Years into Skills, Projects, and Bets</h2>
  <div class="space-y-4">
    <p>For each year, pick a small number of skills to deepen, projects to pursue, and 'bets' you want to place (like a lateral move or a new domain).</p>
    <p>Your roadmap should fit on a single page. If it doesn't, you won't use it.</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>A good roadmap doesn't guarantee a specific job, but it makes sure your effort compounds. Review it every few months, adjust, and keep moving in the same general direction.</p>
