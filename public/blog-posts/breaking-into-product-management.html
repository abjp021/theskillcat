  You don't need a computer science degree or a fancy title to break into product management. What you do need is proof that you can understand users, work with tech and business, and ship outcomes—not just features.

  <h2>1. Start by Owning a Problem, Not a Title</h2>
  <div class="space-y-4">
    <p>Most people wait for a PM title before they start acting like a PM. That's backwards.</p>
    <p>Pick a real problem in your current role (or in a side project), talk to the people who feel that pain, and design a small solution. Document how you discovered the problem, what you tried, and what changed.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>2. Build a Small, Real Portfolio—Not Pretty Case Studies</h2>
  <div class="space-y-4">
    <p>Instead of 10 Dribbble-style case studies, aim for 2–3 solid, real stories:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
      <li>A process you improved</li>
      <li>A dashboard or workflow you helped design</li>
      <li>A small feature you shipped with measurable impact</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Show your thinking, trade-offs, and results. That's what hiring managers look for.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>3. Translate Your Current Experience into PM Language</h2>
  <div class="space-y-4">
    <p>You might already be doing PM-adjacent work without calling it that. Operations, support, sales, and analytics roles all touch real problems and users.</p>
    <p>Rewrite your resume bullets to highlight:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
      <li>Problems you identified</li>
      <li>Decisions you influenced</li>
      <li>Metrics you moved</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>You don't have to pause your career to 'switch' into product. Start acting like a PM where you are today, collect proof, and use that to make your next move.</p>
